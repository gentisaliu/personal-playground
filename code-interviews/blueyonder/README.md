# Blue Yonder Coding Interview

Create a simple data pipeline:

1. Take the data from http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml
2. Write a Python program that calculates the average trip length of all Yellow Taxis for a month.
3. Extend this to a data pipeline that can ingest new data and calculates the 45 day rolling average trip length.
