# CMake Sample

This sample shows the required configuration for CMake that builds two executables, `program1`, `program2`, 
from source.

Both programs use classes contained in the source code, a header-only library and a static library (.so).

## Running the sample

```bash
$ cd cmake-sample-basic
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
```
